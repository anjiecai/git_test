         "anchors" to another destination, aka requires the other location specified
         
         attributes:
         * href (hypertext reference) - controls where to go, absolute or relative link to resource
         * target - controls where the linked resource will be opened
           - `_self` is current tab (default)
           - `_blank` is new tab or window (based on browser settings)
         * rel (relationship) - describes relationship between current page and linked document
           - `noopener` prevents the new page from accessing current page window object and parent frame, aka making edits
           - `noreferrer` prevents opened link from knowing the referrer
